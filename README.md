## Description

The **Expense and Approval Management System** allows company employees to submit expenses (e.g., meals, travel, office supplies) for approval. Approvers and finance personnel can manage and approve these expenses through a series of automated workflows and role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with specific data.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Approval Process**: Creates approval and finance records automatically based on expense submission status.
- **Role-Based Access Control (ACL)**: Ensures only authorized users can view or edit data in specific tables.
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: Status and employee name fields are updated automatically for a user-friendly experience.
- **Inter-User Communication**: Approvers and requestors can communicate within the system via work notes.

## Database Structure

### Expense Submission Table
- **Purpose**: Allows users to submit expenses incurred during company time, such as meals, travel, or office supplies.
- **Access**: Regular users can view this table only; they cannot access other tables.
- **Key Fields**: 
  - Expense ID
  - Status
  - Employee Name
  - Work Notes
  - Expense Details

### Approval Table
- **Purpose**: Allows approvers to review and approve expense submissions.
- **Access**: Only visible to approvers; approvers can view both this table and the Expense Submission Table.
- **Automatic Creation**: An entry in this table is created automatically upon expense submission.

### Finance Table
- **Purpose**: Enables finance personnel to finalize expenses post-approval.
- **Access**: Finance users can view both the Finance Table and Expense Submission Table but cannot access the Approval Table.
- **Automatic Creation**: An entry is created in this table only after an expense is approved.

## Access Control üîí

Roles and groups were created to enforce access control through Access Control Lists (ACLs), ensuring that:

- **Regular Users**: Can only view the Expense Submission Table.
- **Approvers**: Can view and manage records in both the Approval Table and Expense Submission Table.
- **Finance Personnel**: Can view and manage records in the Finance Table and Expense Submission Table.

## Automation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Client Scripts
- **Status Update**: When a form is submitted, the status of the expense changes from empty to ‚ÄúPending Approval.‚Äù
- **Employee Name Update**: The employee name field automatically populates with the name of the user who initially opens the form.

### Business Rules
- **Auto-Creation of Approval Records**: Creates a new approval record in the Approval Table when a user submits an expense.
- **Work Notes Communication**: Allows approvers and users to communicate via work notes in the system, facilitating clear interaction about the expense status and other details.
